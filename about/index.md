Derisked is a new project by Josh Jacobson ([Email](mailto:Josh@Derisked.org){:target="blank"}, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmjacobson/){:target="blank"}).

It was started on the notion that:

* Many people are concerned with their longevity and continued productivity
* Few have the time to look in to the many possibilities for how to optimize that
* It could be impactful to provide research & implementation assistance toward this

Therefore this project is focused on the discovery, examination, and implementation of promising, neglected physical-world interventions that can safeguard life and productivity. I will identify risks and interventions, perform literature reviews and statistical analysis to determine their cost and potential for alleviation, and produce research outputs summarizing this work and the cost-efficiency of potential risk-alleviating actions. These recommendations may be shared via forums, talks, consulting, and direct implementation.
