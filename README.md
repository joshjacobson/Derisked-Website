## Development to-dos

- Create document outline, on left side, like LW and GDocs, probably collapsed with many screens but openable via clicking symbol
- Make obvious that footnotes are clickable on mobile (colored, or background WBW style)
- Make footnotes collapsible or click to expland like on mobile for bigger screen sizes, to accommodate outline?
- Figure out pdf display, imagemap, etc., maybe using media queries?
